# my-portfolio

## What is this?
This website shows everything I done ever since I started Boot Camp up to the current date


## Features:
* My Biography
* My Past Projects
* An image of myself
* Link to my GitHub page
* Links to contact me in the footer
* Compatable with smaller screen sizes


## Note
While there are minor issues that I couldn't figure out, like with the footer where I can't get the spacing between the two contacts. It's something I'll be going back to where it'll be constantly updated down the road.
